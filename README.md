# SingleLaneRoad

This repository contains the Unity scene, including all assets, for the SingleLaneRoad default map in SVL Simulator. This example map provisions a simple, two-way single lane, straight road that can be used for test cases and SVL Simulator API usage. 

You can use this repository as a template if you would like to create a similar but custom map for use in SVL Simulator.
